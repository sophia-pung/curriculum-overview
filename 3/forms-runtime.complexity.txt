*Runtime Complexity*
What is runtime complexity?
Understand the following runtimes: O(1), O(log n), O(n), O(n log n), O(n^2), and O(2^n)
-order n: look at every single page in the dictionary, runtime is proportional to the input
-order log n: # of pages is equivalent to the log of n, 10*x = 3, usually pretty small
-Runtime complexity tells you how the program would scale, based on the input

How do we talk about runtime complexity?
-In terms of big O notation, using O, relative to the input (n)

Give me an example of each the following run times: Constant, linear, O(n^2)...
-constant, throwing a dicionary away, searching through the dictionary to find a word page by page, n^2, two for-loops

*Command Line Interfaces*
Please define the terminal, bash, zsh, git. How are they similar, how are they different?
-terminal: terminal immulator, window that comes up. the window floating on your screen (graphical program)
-bash and zsh: are the langugues you use within the terminal
-git: a source control language that is used to tracking changes in the source code

*HTML Forms*
How to create HTML forms.
<forms>

How to add validation in the attributes.
<required>

How to submit the form.
<submit>

Create a practice for with each type of form field...
-Text: text field- no autofill
-Radio: round buttons for users to check
-Checkbox: square buttons for users to check
-Select (dropdown): select from a dropdown menu

Understand how the <label> relates to the form element, (Note there are 2 ways of adding a label to a form field, what are they?)
-label allows you to connect the input button and gives it a label, Firstly, use <label> tag by providing the <input> and id attribute. The <label> tag needs a for attribute whose value is the same as input id.
-Alternatively, <input> tag use directly inside the <label> tag. In this case, the for and id attributes are not needed because the association is implicit.

What is in the form “event” on submit?
-a submit button
