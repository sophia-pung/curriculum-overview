*Complex Objects*
What is the syntax for declaring an Object?
-var or const <object-name> = { key1: value1, key2: value2,...};

What are Complex Objects? Give an example.
-Complex Objects are Objects with other Objects inside of them.
-vehicles = {
  "Jim's Ford Focus": { "color": "white", "isDamaged": true, "wheels": 4 },
  "Bob's Suzuki Swift": { "color": "green", "isDamaged": false, "wheels": 4 },
  "Alex's Harley Davidson": { "color": "black", "isDamaged": false, "wheels": 2 }
};

Explain some built-in Object Methods in JavaScript.
-Object.keys(obj): Returns an array of the keys that the object contains.
-Object.values(obj): Returns an array of the values of each of the elements in the object.
-Object.entries(obj): Returns an array containing nested arrays for each key-value pair. The first element in each nested array is the key, and the second is the value.

What is a property of an Object?
-The values associated with a JavaScript object.
-ex: in vehicles up above, the properties are the cars in the object.

How do you access nested objects inside an array?
