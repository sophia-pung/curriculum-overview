*DOM*  

##### What is the DOM?
- The DOM, a document object model is an API, in the sense that you use DOM commands to access the DOM API to render the changes in the structure of the document.

---

##### What kind of events are there and what do events do? (see a list of event types here)
- DOM events allow JavaScript to connect different event handlers to elements in an HTML document.
- example: button click, page reload, taking in input (submitting a button)

##### What is an event listener?
- An event listener is a method that waits for changes which then triggers a reaction with some functionality.

##### Why might I use one?
- Event listeners can be used to submit data on a button click.

##### How do I select something in the DOM?
- using a JS method with the format `<element of document interface>.<selection method>(<name of selector>);`

##### How do I get something by class name?

##### How do I get something by ID?

*CSS*
---

##### What is CSS?
- Cascading Style Sheets is a stylesheet language used to describe the presentation of a document written in HTML or XML.

---

##### Why Cascading?
- The “cascading” in CSS refers to the fact that styling rules “cascade” down from several sources. This means that CSS has an inherent hierarchy and styles of a higher precedence will overwrite rules of a lower precedence.

---

##### Does order matter?
- If a rule from the same style sheet, with the same level of specificity exists, the rule that is declared last in the CSS document will be the one that is applied.

---

##### What is the difference between a Class and an ID?
- Class can be used on multiple elements and ID can only be used on one, ID is more specific.

---

##### Do you know what a parent, child, sibling component is?

##### What does inline, block, inline-block mean?
- Inline: Displays an element as an inline element. Any height and width properties will have no effect.
- Block: Displays an element as an inline-level block container. You CAN set height and width values.
- Inline-Block: It’s formatted just like the inline element, where it doesn’t start on a new line. BUT, you can set width and height values. No line-break after the element, so the element can sit next to other elements.

---

##### Can you name one element that natively has each of those display properties?
- Inline: button, input, span
- Block: div, p, h1-h6, ul, ol, table
- #check with Cristina Inline-Block: any inline element, whose display is set to inline-block
