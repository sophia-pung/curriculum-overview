*CSS*
What is CSS?
-Cascading Style Sheets is a stylesheet language used to describe the presentation of a document written in HTML or XML.

Why Cascading?
-The “cascading” in CSS refers to the fact that styling rules “cascade” down from several sources. This means that CSS has an inherent hierarchy and styles of a higher precedence will overwrite rules of a lower precedence.

Does order matter?
-If a rule from the same style sheet, with the same level of specificity exists, the rule that is declared last in the CSS document will be the one that is applied.

What is the difference between a Class and an ID?
-Class can be used on multiple elements and ID can only be used on one, ID is more specific.

What does inline, block, inline-block mean?
-Inline: Displays an element as an inline element. Any height and width properties will have no effect.
-Block: Displays an element as an inline-level block container. You CAN set height and width values.
-Inline-Block: It’s formatted just like the inline element, where it doesn’t start on a new line. BUT, you can set width and height values. No line-break after the element, so the element can sit next to other elements.

Can you name one element that natively has each of those display properties?
-Inline: button, input, span
-Block: div, p, h1-h6, ul, ol, table
-#check with Cristina Inline-Block: any inline element, whose display is set to inline-block
