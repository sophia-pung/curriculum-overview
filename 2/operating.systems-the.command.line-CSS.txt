*Operating Systems*
What is an operating system?

How does it differ from a “normal program” (such as word)

What is Linux, why do people LOOOOVVVEE it?

*The Command line*
-How do I move into a directory? (aka Change Directory)
cd x
-How do I go up a directory level?
cd ..
-How do I go to my root directory?
cd /
-How do I make a new directory?
cd mkdir
-How do I make a new file?
touch
-How do I check what version of a program I am using?
--version

*CSS*
What is the box model?
-The CSS box model is a box that wraps around every HTML element. It consists of: margins, borders, padding, and the actual content.

How does padding relate to the box?
-The padding section of the CSS Box Model sits in the space between the HTML content and the border.

How do margins relate to the box?
-The margin is an invisible space around your box. It pushes other elements away from the box. Margins can have positive or negative values. Setting a negative margin on one side of your box can cause it to overlap other things on the page.

Display (get these memorized)
-Inline: Displays an element as an inline element. Any height and width properties will have no effect.
-Block: Displays an element as an inline-level block container. You CAN set height and width values.
-Inline-Block: It’s formatted just like the inline element, where it doesn’t start on a new line. BUT, you can set width and height values. No line-break after the element, so the element can sit next to other elements.
Why would I want to change the default display of a span? (hint: can you add padding and margins to the top/bottom of an inline element? Why / Why not?)
-to add padding and margins to the top/bottom of an inline element.
