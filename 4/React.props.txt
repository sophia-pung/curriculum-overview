What is JSX?
-JSX- JavaScript syntax extension. It is a JavaScript (extension) that allows us to describe React's object tree using a syntax that resembles that of an HTML template. It is just an XML-like extension that allows us to write JavaScript that looks like markup and have it returned from a component.

-The term "package" is used to describe code that's been made publicly available. A package can contain a single file or many files of code.

An extension language is a programming language interpreter offered by an application program, so that users can write macros or even full-fledged programs to extend the original application.

ex: do this with code, drill down to see how it works. code is language, write it down in my language and explain it to myself. share with expert and get clarification.
"childlike wonder how everything works"- let child play when you don't understand. takes away the fear. no fear yet, fear doesn't let you learn.
changes your interaction with code. so much data- be skeptical in google, see what the context of the data. get another source to double check.
embrace that I might not know. (rabbit hole- computers are just files all the way down)- if you run out of places to look.
"how do I find something about _x_?"
